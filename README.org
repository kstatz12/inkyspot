** Configuration
The only requred configuration is to fill out the .env.template file with your spotify application's information (Client Secret, Client Id and Callback URL)

The callback URL for running this on a local machine should be `http://localhost:8080` and this needs to match in your spotify settings.
** Running
To get started run `./start.sh` to spin up the spotify proxy. this will handle auth to spotify and proxy requests to spotify using your user's auth token

Navigate to `http://localhost:8080` and click `Login`. this will redirect you to spotify to login, once you log in it will redirect you back and it should say "ok". You can close your web browser.
